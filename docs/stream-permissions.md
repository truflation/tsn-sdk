# Stream Permissions in TSN

The Truflation Stream Network (TSN) provides granular control over stream access and visibility. This document outlines the permission system, how to configure it, and best practices for securing your streams.

## Permission Types

TSN supports two main types of permissions:

1. **Read Permissions**: Control who can read data from a stream.
2. **Compose Permissions**: Determine which streams can use this stream as a child in a composed stream.

## Visibility Settings

Streams can be set to one of two visibility states:

- **Public**: Accessible to all users.
- **Private**: Accessible only to specifically allowed wallets or streams.

## Managing Permissions

### Setting Stream Visibility

To set a stream's visibility:

```go
// Set read visibility
txHash, err := stream.SetReadVisibility(ctx, util.PrivateVisibility)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Set compose visibility
txHash, err := stream.SetComposeVisibility(ctx, util.PublicVisibility)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Allowing Specific Wallets to Read

For private streams, you can allow specific wallets to read data:

```go
txHash, err := stream.AllowReadWallet(ctx, readerAddress)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Allowing Streams to Compose

You can allow specific streams to use your stream as a child in composition:

```go
txHash, err := stream.AllowComposeStream(ctx, composedStreamLocator)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Revoking Permissions

To revoke previously granted permissions:

```go
// Revoke read permission
txHash, err := stream.DisableReadWallet(ctx, readerAddress)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Revoke compose permission
txHash, err := stream.DisableComposeStream(ctx, composedStreamLocator)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

## Checking Current Permissions

You can query the current permission settings:

```go
// Check read visibility
visibility, err := stream.GetReadVisibility(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Get allowed read wallets
allowedWallets, err := stream.GetAllowedReadWallets(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Get allowed compose streams
allowedStreams, err := stream.GetAllowedComposeStreams(ctx)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

## Permission Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Public Read, Private Compose

This configuration allows anyone to read the stream data, but only specific streams can use it in composition.

```go
stream.SetReadVisibility(ctx, util.PublicVisibility)
stream.SetComposeVisibility(ctx, util.PrivateVisibility)
stream.AllowComposeStream(ctx, allowedStreamLocator)
```

### Scenario 2: Private Read, Public Compose

Only specific wallets can read the stream data, but any stream can use it in composition.

```go
stream.SetReadVisibility(ctx, util.PrivateVisibility)
stream.SetComposeVisibility(ctx, util.PublicVisibility)
stream.AllowReadWallet(ctx, allowedReaderAddress)
```

### Scenario 3: Fully Private

Both reading and composing are restricted to specifically allowed entities.

```go
stream.SetReadVisibility(ctx, util.PrivateVisibility)
stream.SetComposeVisibility(ctx, util.PrivateVisibility)
stream.AllowReadWallet(ctx, allowedReaderAddress)
stream.AllowComposeStream(ctx, allowedStreamLocator)
```

## Caveats and Considerations

- Changing permissions requires blockchain transactions. Always wait for transaction confirmation before assuming the change has taken effect.

By leveraging these permission controls, you can create secure, flexible data streams that meet your specific needs while maintaining control over your valuable data within the TSN ecosystem.
