            Hey there! üëãüèº

            We require pull request titles to follow [Truflation's Developer Guideline](https://github.com/truflation/developers) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved

            Hey there! üëãüèº

            We require pull request titles to follow the max length convention and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.
